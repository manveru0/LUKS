To build the whole shebang, run: make.  It'll download the sources, untar
them, patch them, and set everything up, then build everything and install it
into external/lib, external/include, etc.

Build Products
--------------

The most interesting thing is probably: LUKS/external/sbin/cryptsetup.static

You can actually see a little UNIX hierarchy once everything builds:
LUKS/external/bin
LUKS/external/include
LUKS/external/lib
LUKS/external/sbin
LUKS/external/share


Notes About This Build
----------------------

- Android's bionic libc does not include getline() or getdelim(), so we needed
  to get it from GNU libc.  The getline.c, getline.h, getdelim.c, and
  getdelim.h files in the cryptsetup patch are from:
  http://android-wifi-tether.googlecode.com/svn/tools/wireless-tools/

- This was developed on an Debian/Sid i386 32-bit machine.  It might work
  on other setups, but no guarantees.

- config.guess and config.sub are included from libtool 2.4 to support the
  'arm-linux-androideabi' host type.  Most of the tarballs include older
  versions of those scripts, which do not know about the Android host type.

- some pkg-config files are included if you happen to want to use this stuff
  to build other programs for Android
